# Crowdfunding

A simple and secure crowdfunding smart contract built with Solidity. This contract allows individuals to contribute funds towards a specified funding goal. Once the goal is reached, only the contract owner can withdraw the funds. Key features include:

Goal-based fundraising: Donations are accepted until the funding goal (in ETH) is reached.

Donor tracking: Keeps a record of individual donations.

Withdrawal control: Funds can only be withdrawn by the owner after the goal is met and only once.

Read-only access: Public functions to check total balance and individual contributions.
